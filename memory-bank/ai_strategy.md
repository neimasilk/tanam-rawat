# AI Strategy for Tanam Rawat

This document outlines the long-term strategy for developing and integrating the internal AI model for plant identification in the Tanam Rawat application.

## 1. Vision & Goals
- **Vision:** To provide the most accurate and hyper-localized plant identification for Indonesian flora.
- **Goal:** Achieve >90% identification accuracy for common Indonesian plant species.

## 2. Data Acquisition Strategy
- **Phase 1 (Initial):** Leverage existing public datasets (if available and relevant) and collaborate with local botanical institutions/experts.
- **Phase 2 (Ongoing):** Implement a user-contributed image collection feature within the Tanam Rawat app, allowing users to submit images for model improvement (with proper consent and privacy considerations).
- **Data Annotation:** Establish a robust process for annotating and validating image data, potentially involving domain experts.

## 3. Model Development & Training
- **Architecture Exploration:** Experiment with various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet) suitable for mobile deployment and real-time inference.
- **Transfer Learning:** Utilize pre-trained models on large general image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and fine-tune them with our specific Indonesian plant dataset.
- **Training Environment:** Utilize cloud-based GPU resources (e.g., Google Cloud AI Platform, AWS SageMaker) for efficient model training.
- **Version Control:** Implement version control for datasets and trained models.

## 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary:** Top-1 Accuracy, Top-5 Accuracy.
- **Secondary:** Precision, Recall, F1-score (especially for less common species).
- **Performance:** Inference time on target devices/backend.

## 5. Integration with Backend
- The trained AI model will be deployed as a service (e.g., using FastAPI's capabilities for model serving, or a dedicated model serving framework like TensorFlow Serving/TorchServe).
- The `POST /identify` endpoint in the FastAPI backend will be updated to:
    1. Receive the image.
    2. Preprocess the image (resize, normalize).
    3. Send the preprocessed image to the deployed AI model for inference.
    4. Receive the prediction from the AI model.
    5. Return the identified plant name and confidence score to the frontend.

## 6. Iterative Improvement
- The AI model development will be an ongoing, iterative process.
- Regularly collect new data, retrain models, and deploy updated versions to improve accuracy and cover more species.

## 7. Risks & Mitigation
- **Data Scarcity:** Mitigate by proactive data collection strategies and partnerships.
- **Model Bias:** Address through diverse dataset collection and careful evaluation across different plant categories.
- **Computational Cost:** Optimize model size and efficiency for deployment, and leverage cloud resources for training.
